When we started creating our build farm we quickly realised how time-consuming this could be and so we wanted to find a neat solution to save us some time. One of the biggest issues that we found was giving people temporary access to machines. We would often find that the access was never revoked and this therefore became an administrators nightmare."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/creating-an-open-source-build-farm/","postPath":"/2017/08/creating-an-open-source-build-farm/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 05, 2017","title":"Creating an Open Source Build Farm","description":"When it comes to any community driven open source project, funding is always the limiting factor.
